In this category you will learn how to make a tasty sandwich.
The key ingredients in a sandwich are: bread, spread, and filling.
When making a sandwich, you need to first put down one slice of bread,
then apply any spreads, and finally add filling.  Popular fillings
include cheese, sprouts, and cold cuts.  When you are done, apply
another slice of bread on top, and optionally tie it together with
a fancy toothpick.
